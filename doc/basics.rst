Basics: how to write a simple pipeline
======================================

Now that we have a working installation of ``bistro`` and ``docker``,
let us get back to our original goal, namely to write pipelines of
scientific computations. In the following we'll use the ``utop``
interpreter to run an OCaml script. If you write your code in a file
named ``pipeline.ml``, you can run it by typing

.. code-block:: bash

   $ utop pipeline.ml

which will create a ``_bistro`` directory used to store the results of
the pipeline. We'll get back to that later, let's now start with a
minimal example.
