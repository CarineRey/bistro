v0.1.0 2016-05-19 Lyon
----------------------

Many minor changes in API.

Installation scripts for tools are no longer considered part of
analysis workflow. Installing programs should be dealt with outside
bistro.

Features:
- heredoc for shell EDSL
- new np and mem tokens for scripts, as a way to use only the
  resources that were allocated to a run

Bug fixes:
- bistro execution hangs on utop (f4f932f)
- don't save workflow in database statistics, just its id (issue #4)
